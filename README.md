# FortranVS
FortranVS is an extension for Visual Studio that adds syntax highlighting, project files, and build tools for Fortran. Let's face it, Fortran is not going away anytime soon, so having the ability to use Fortran in Visual Studio would be immensely helpful for developers developing Fortran code in Visual Studio (that are not pay to play like Intel Fortran).
## Roadmap and Vision
* Syntax highlighting for all Fortran key words encompassing most if not all standards (Fortran 77, Fortran 90/95, Fortran 2003, etc).
* Allow creation of Visual Studio solution and Fortran project files
* Allow user to configure build and compiler options (e.g. gfortran)
* Basically have features that would be present for any other language supported by Visual Studio (e.g. C++, C#, etc).
