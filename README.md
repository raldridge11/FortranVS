# FortranVS
FortranVS is an extension for Visual Studio that adds syntax highlighting, project files, and build tools for Fortran. Let's face it, Fortran is not going away anytime soon, so having the ability to use Fortran in Visual Studio would be immensely helpful for developers developing Fortran code in Visual Studio (that are not pay to play like Intel Fortran).
